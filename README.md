Live Chat, Live Draw, and Chatroom (in progress)

**Chatroom isn't there yet.

CD to the containing folder.
Enter into the terminal: "node app.js"
Should now work in your browser at localhost:6790

These apps are meant to be used by multiple people simulataneously.

To simulate this on your own, open the link normally, then with a different browser and with Chrome's incognito mode (to see the apps' functionality).
